## Overview

Welcome to the ```ORE ID``` ecosystem.  ORE ID service is your gateway to building Web3.0 applications.  The main features to harness include: account authentication, blockchain account creation, and easy blockchain interaction for your user base.  

This article series follows the implementation of ORE ID service into a JavaScript ```React``` application.   We will cover the basics of integrating the ORE ID core service.  Explain how to engage user actions with the ```webpopup plugin```.  And, how to create custom transactions using ```ChainJs```.  This guide will walk you step-by-step through the creation of a simple ORE ID application in React.

This series prepares an ORE ID powered application that will work on the ```Ethereum``` Blockchain.  We use the ```Ropsten``` testnet while developing the application so real funds are not used.

> ðŸ’¥ Note: The application in this guide can be easily adapted to run on the *```Polygon```* chain.  Look for tips, starting in article six, for info on how to adapt the application for the Polygon Blockchain.  Multi-chain is one of the main facets of the ORE ID service.  Creating apps that work with multiple blockchains will require very minor code changes. Write the code once, and easily operate on different blockchains.

## How to use this walkthrough

Each article has a complete set of code.  The code covers the topic discussed in the corresponding article. The complete project is available in the folder of the final article.  This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

### Sign Up for an ORE ID Developer Account

Create a new ORE ID application at https://oreid.io/developer/new-app. Make sure you select Ethereum Ropsten to follow along with this walkthrough.

### Quick Setup
This guide comes with a script that will set up the projects in each article's folder for use.  Be sure to first add your app_id to the .env.local-example file.  Then, run the quickstart script by entering the following in the command shell.

```bash
sh quickstart.sh
```

All of the articles will now be ready to start.  Start each article seperatly using ```yarn start``` from inside the articles folder.

### Manuall install project dependencies:

If you wish to run the sample code. It will be necessarry to install the dependencies in each of the article's folder.  

```shell
yarn install
```

### Run the final app in development mode:

```shell
cd 7-Creating_Custom_Transactions
yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view your application in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

> Note: Due to a bug in Create React App 5 - use ```'GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false react-scripts start'``` to start the app or you may see the error 'Failed to parse source map...'

## Project Clean Up
Kill the nodejs instances using ```ctrl + c``` in the terminal.
Then, delete the ```oreid-react-walkthrough``` folder.

## TLDR

This walkthrough was created to show off the core functionality of ORE ID.  ORE ID is a Web3.0 authentication and blockchain interaction service. The goal of this article is to explain how to implement this product into a React application. Follow along to get ORE ID integrated into your application.  You will also learn basic functionality for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain.
